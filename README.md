## 📌 About the Project

The **AutoSuggest and Autocorrect System** is a smart text assistance tool designed to improve typing efficiency and reduce spelling errors. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the system identifies and corrects misspelled words while also providing real-time suggestions for alternative or related terms.

Whether you're writing emails, composing documents, or coding, this system helps ensure your input is accurate and polished.

## 🧠 How It Works

The system operates in three core stages:

1. **Input Processing** – Takes the user's input and tokenizes it into manageable components.
2. **Spell Checking** – Compares the tokens against a dictionary or corpus using edit distance and phonetic similarity.
3. **Suggestion Generation** – Returns the top suggested corrections and possible word continuations.
